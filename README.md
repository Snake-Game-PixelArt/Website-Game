# Snake Game

Welcome to my Snake Game project! ðŸŽ® <br>
> [**PLAY NOW!**](https://snake-game-pixelart.github.io/Website-Game/)

## Overview

This is a classic snake game that I've built as a personal challenge. Instead of using the traditional HTML5 canvas, I decided to create the game using CSS and the `box-shadow` property. By creatively applying `box-shadow` to a single element, I've constructed a grid (or mesh) that serves as the game board, allowing the snake to move and grow.

### Inspiration

I was inspired by the book ["Greatest CSS Tricks"](https://css-tricks.com/books/greatest-css-tricks/), which showcases creative ways to use CSS. In particular, I was fascinated by the technique of drawing using `box-shadow`, as demonstrated by Codrin Pavel's [Steve Jobs](https://codepen.io/zerospree/pen/tFvCw) and Jay Salvat's [Mona Lisa](https://codepen.io/jaysalvat/pen/HaqBf).

## Features

- **Playable on both PC and Mobile:**
  - **PC:** Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
  - **Mobile:** On-screen buttons are displayed for controlling the snake.
- **No Canvas:** The entire game board is rendered using CSS `box-shadow`.
- **Responsive Design:** The game adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktops and mobile devices.
